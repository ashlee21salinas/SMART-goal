"Reptiles are cold-blooded, vertebrate animals that belong to the class Reptilia, which includes snakes, lizards, turtles, crocodiles, and alligators. They are covered in dry, scaly skin that helps prevent water loss, allowing them to live in a wide range of environments, from deserts to forests. Unlike amphibians, reptiles lay their eggs on land, and many have tough, leathery shells that protect the embryos inside. Most reptiles breathe through lungs and rely on external heat sources, like the sun, to regulate their body temperature. Reptiles have been around for over 300 million years and play important roles in ecosystems, acting as both predators and prey in food chains.",
"Giraffes are the tallest land animals on Earth, known for their extremely long necks, long legs, and distinctive coat patterns made up of brown patches separated by lighter lines. Native to the savannas and open woodlands of Africa, giraffes use their long necks to reach leaves, flowers, and fruits high up in trees, especially from acacia trees, which are a favorite food source. Despite their height, giraffes have the same number of neck vertebrae as humans—seven—but each bone is much longer. They live in loose social groups and are generally gentle animals, although males may fight by swinging their necks and heads in a behavior called necking. Giraffes are currently considered vulnerable due to habitat loss, poaching, and population decline in some regions, making conservation efforts increasingly important.",
