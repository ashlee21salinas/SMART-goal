                <p>The Great Depression was a severe worldwide economic crisis that began in 1929 after the U.S.
                    stock market crashed. It led to massive unemployment, with about 25% of Americans out of work
                    at the peak of the crisis. Banks collapsed, savings were lost, and businesses shut down, leaving
                    many families in poverty and struggling to survive. Farmers suffered greatly as crop prices dropped,
                    and environmental disasters like the Dust Bowl made things worse in rural areas. The depression
                    spread
                    to other countries, creating a global economic slowdown. In response, U.S. President Franklin D.
                    Roosevelt
                    introduced the New Deal, a series of government programs designed to create jobs, support the poor,
                    and help
                    the economy recover. Although the New Deal helped, the economy did not fully recover until the
                    increased production
                    demands of World War II.</p>
